# Algorithms

1. **ACO.cpp** - Ant Colony Optimization  
   - **Time Complexity:** Varies depending on parameters, generally \(O(n \cdot W)\)
   
2. **Backtracking.cpp** - Recursive brute-force with pruning  
   - **Time Complexity:** \(O(2^n)\) (exponential)
   
3. **BranchAndBound.cpp** - Branch and Bound with bounding to prune the search space  
   - **Time Complexity:** Exponential in the worst case, but much faster than brute force in practice

4. **DP.cpp** - Dynamic Programming  
   - **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \cdot W)\)

5. **Memoization.cpp** - Dynamic Programming with Memoization  
   - **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \cdot W)\)

6. **Recursive.cpp** - Recursive solution without optimization  
   - **Time Complexity:** \(O(2^n)\) (exponential)
   
7. **SimulatedAnnealing.cpp** - Simulated Annealing (Metallurgy-inspired)  
   - **Time Complexity:** Varies based on cooling schedule and iterations
