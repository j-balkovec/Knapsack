# Knapsack Project Data Files

## Overview
The CSV files used for the Knapsack project are not included in this repository. This is because the data files are just simply too big (+ I don't want to deal with Git's `lfs` `:)`) and are automatically generated when needed.

## Generating the Data Files
To generate the necessary CSV files, simply run the `<input_generator.py>` script. This script will create all the required data files for the project.

### Steps to Generate Data Files
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python input_generator.py
   ```

### Issues

If you encounter any issues while running the script, please refer to the logs for more information. If the issue persists, know that it works on my machine `:)`.
